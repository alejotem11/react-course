Example of converting the properties of a JS Object to an array of objects: (check the Order.js file in the burger-builder project)

	Example of the object:
	{bacon: 0, cheese: 1, meat: 2, salad: 1}
	
	Expected array:
	[{
		name: bacon,
		amount: 0
	}, {
		name: cheese,
		amount: 1
	}, {
		name: meat,
		amount: 2
	}, {
		name: salad,
		amount: 1
	}]
	
	Code:
	const ingredients = [];
	for (let ingredientName in props.ingredients) {
		ingredients.push({
		  name: ingredientName,
		  amount: props.ingredients[ingredientName]
		});
	}
