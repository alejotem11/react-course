Radium module:
radium --> To use inline styles with pseudo selectors and media queries
$ yarn add radium

CSS Modules: https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules
CSS Modules let you use the same CSS class name in different files without worrying about naming clashes,
thus you can scope a style to a specific file
Using CSS Modules in create-react-app Projects: https://medium.com/nulogy/how-to-use-css-modules-with-create-react-app-9e44bec2b5c2

1. Run the command:
$ yarn eject
this command will make available the webpack config files under the config folder
2. Edit the webpack.config.dev.js and the webpack.config.prod.js file:
You'll have to find the following part in your webpack.config.js file:
{
  test: cssRegex,
  exclude: cssModuleRegex,
  ...
}
and then edit that entry, to add the properties 'modules' and 'localIdentName'
as you can see below:

{
  test: cssRegex,
  exclude: cssModuleRegex,
  use: getStyleLoaders({
      importLoaders: 1,
      modules: true,
      localIdentName: '[name]__[local]__[hash:base64:5]'
  }),
  ...
}
3. Restart the server

See: https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/v4/t/lecture/8111608?start=0
if you somehow also want to define a global (i.e. un-transformed) CSS class in such a .css  file, you can prefix the selector with :global .

Example:

:global .Post { ... }

Alternatively, you can now also use CSS modules without ejecting (you still can though, it won't be a problem). In a non-ejected project created with create-react-app, you can use CSS modules as described here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet
